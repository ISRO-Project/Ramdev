### Work Assigned -> SOC vs FPGA

# SoC (System on Chip):

-> A System on a Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that integrates most or all components of a computer or other electronic system1. It usually includes a CPU (via a microprocessor or microcontroller), memory, input/output (I/O) ports, and secondary storage on a single substrate, such as silicon.

-> Higher-performance SoCs are often paired with dedicated and physically separate memory and secondary storage (such as LPDDR and eUFS or eMMC, respectively) chips, that may be layered on top of the SoC in what's known as a package on package (PoP) configuration, or be placed close to the SoC. Additionally, SoCs may use separate wireless modems.

-> Characteristics:
  - High level of integration
  - Low power consumption
  - Fixed architecture
  - Limited flexibility

#FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array):
